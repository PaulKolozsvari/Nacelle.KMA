  Kindly ensure that you read them carefully before using the app. The app is for your own personal use.
  Please be aware that you cannot send it on to anyone else, and you’re not allowed to copy,
  or modify or change any part of the app, or make any derivative versions of the app,
  or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,

  At the bottom of these terms and conditions you will be able to find links to our website where we set out
  our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and the general Terms and Conditions for passengers and baggage, which will

  kulula.com is committed to ensuring that the app is user friendly for our customers.
  For that reason, we reserve the right, at any time and for any reason, to make changes to the app,

<h3>
  kulula.com Travel App
</h3>
<p>
  The kulula.com Travel App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us.
  It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
  We recommend that you do not remove software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
  It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it
  could mean that the kulula.com app won’t work properly or at all.
</p>
<p>
  kulula.com will not take responsibility for certain functions of the app which will require the app to have an active internet connection.
  The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but kulula.com cannot take responsibility for the app not
  working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of agreement with your mobile network
  provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
  connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges,
  including roaming data charges, if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
  If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
  permission from the bill payer to use the app.
</p>
<p>
  kulula.com cannot take responsibility for the way you use the app. If you want to use the mobile boarding pass feature of the app,
  it’s possible that kulula.com staff, airport security staff and others, may need to briefly handle your device when your boarding
  pass is scanned. While kulula.com staff will take all reasonable care to make sure nothing happens to your device, we don’t accept
  liability for damage to it, unless it’s caused by any negligence or wilful misconduct by our staff. We do not accept any
  responsibility or liability for the handling of your device by third parties. You also need to make sure that your device stays charged.
  If your device can’t turned on to scan your boarding pass as required, kulula.com cannot accept responsibility if you are,
  as a result not able to fly.
</p>
<p>
  You should also remember that the app’s purpose is to make things more convenient for you. It remains your responsibility to ensure
  that you have the correct travel documents and you will still need to bring them to the airport in order to fly. It’s important to
  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that the information contained in the app is updated and correct at all times, we
  do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The app is not intended to replace
  the need to stay informed of updates that are made on screens throughout the airport. kulula.com accepts no liability for any loss,
  direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionality of the app rather than using all the resources
  in the airport to keep yourself updated as to the details of your flight.
</p>
<p>
  At some point we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS. The requirements for both systems may
  change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. kulula.com does not promise that it will always
  update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device.
  However, you should ensure that updates to the application are done when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app,
  and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
  (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
</p>

  If you experience any technical issues with the app, or you would like to contact us regarding these Terms, you may contact
